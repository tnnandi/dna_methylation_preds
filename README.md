# Understanding DNA methylation matterns for haematological conidtions using the DNA foundation model CpGPT

This repository is a fork of the original CpGPT project (https://github.com/lcamillo/CpGPT), focused on studying DNA methylation patterns in Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) and their role in disease progression.

## Project Focus
- Investigating DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures in TET2 and DNMT3A CHIP
- Analysis of longitudinal data from major biobanks (BioVU, FHS, ARIC)
- Developing methylation-based prognostic models for CHIP progression
- Analyzing CHIP's relationship to clonal cytopenia (CCUS) and myeloid neoplasms (MN)
- Understanding CHIP's impact on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)


## Status
Under active development with focus on:
- Identifying methylation signatures in CHIP patients vs controls
- Building integrated risk prediction models
- Validating findings through CRISPR-modified primary CD34+ cells
